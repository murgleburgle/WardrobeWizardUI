# WardrobeWizard - AI-Powered Fashion Database Management System

## Project Overview
WardrobeWizard is a full-stack application for managing and enriching metadata of fashion/outfit image databases using AI models. The system combines a FastAPI backend with various computer vision models and a Reflex dashboard frontend for monitoring and control.

## Backend Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pose Similarity Analysis ‚è≥
**Goal**: Enable comparison and grouping of model poses across outfit photos

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Integrate pose estimation model (OpenPose, MediaPipe, or similar)
- [ ] Extract keypoint coordinates for human body joints
- [ ] Implement pose similarity metrics (e.g., PCK, cosine similarity of joint vectors)
- [ ] Create pose comparison API endpoint (`POST /api/poses/compare`)
- [ ] Build pose clustering functionality to group similar poses
- [ ] Add pose visualization overlay endpoint for debugging
- [ ] Store pose metadata (keypoints, confidence scores) in database

**Data Structure**:
- Pose keypoints: 17-33 body landmarks with (x, y, confidence)
- Similarity scores between image pairs
- Pose cluster assignments

---

### Phase 2: Human Action Classification ‚è≥
**Goal**: Automatically classify actions/activities shown in outfit photos

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Select and integrate action recognition model (e.g., I3D, SlowFast, X3D)
- [ ] Define action taxonomy relevant to fashion (standing, walking, sitting, posing, etc.)
- [ ] Implement video/sequence frame extraction for temporal models
- [ ] Create action classification API endpoint (`POST /api/actions/classify`)
- [ ] Add confidence thresholding and multi-label support
- [ ] Store action labels with confidence scores in database
- [ ] Build action filtering/search functionality

**Action Categories** (example):
- Static poses: standing, sitting, kneeling
- Dynamic actions: walking, running, dancing
- Gestures: waving, pointing, hand-on-hip
- Interactions: with props, with environment

---

### Phase 3: Sequence Detection ‚è≥
**Goal**: Identify and track outfit changes, pose sequences, and temporal patterns

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement temporal sequence analysis for image series
- [ ] Build outfit change detection using embedding similarity
- [ ] Create pose transition detection (e.g., walking sequence, pose flow)
- [ ] Develop sequence clustering (group related photo shoots)
- [ ] Add sequence timeline API (`GET /api/sequences/{shoot_id}`)
- [ ] Implement automatic shoot/session segmentation
- [ ] Store sequence metadata (start/end frames, duration, transitions)

**Sequence Features**:
- Outfit consistency tracking across frames
- Pose progression analysis
- Scene/location continuity detection
- Automatic shoot boundary detection

---

## Frontend Dashboard Enhancements

### Phase 4: Advanced Analytics Visualization üìä
**Goal**: Add rich visual analytics for new backend capabilities

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create pose similarity heatmap view
- [ ] Build action distribution pie/bar charts
- [ ] Add sequence timeline visualization component
- [ ] Implement cluster visualization (outfit clusters, pose clusters)
- [ ] Create interactive pose comparison tool
- [ ] Add filtering by action type, pose cluster, sequence
- [ ] Build export functionality for analytics reports

---

### Phase 5: Batch Operations & Workflow Management üîÑ
**Goal**: Enable efficient bulk processing and workflow automation

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add batch pose analysis controls
- [ ] Create action classification queue management
- [ ] Implement sequence detection pipeline UI
- [ ] Build workflow templates (e.g., "Full Analysis", "Quick Scan")
- [ ] Add progress tracking for multi-stage processing
- [ ] Create retry/reprocess functionality for failed analyses
- [ ] Implement priority queue management

---

### Phase 6: Search & Discovery Features üîç
**Goal**: Advanced search capabilities using enriched metadata

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Build multi-faceted search interface (pose + action + outfit)
- [ ] Add visual similarity search using embeddings
- [ ] Create "find similar poses" feature
- [ ] Implement sequence-based search (find all photos from same shoot)
- [ ] Add action-based filtering (show all "walking" photos)
- [ ] Build clustering explorer UI (browse pose/outfit clusters)
- [ ] Create saved search/filter presets

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack:
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Models**: 
  - Object Detection: (your current model)
  - Classification: (your current model)
  - Captioning: (your current model)
  - Embeddings: (your current model)
  - Pose: TBD (OpenPose/MediaPipe/etc.)
  - Action: TBD (I3D/SlowFast/etc.)
- **Clustering**: K-means (sklearn)
- **Database**: (specify your DB - PostgreSQL/MongoDB/etc.)

### Frontend Stack:
- **Framework**: Reflex (Python-based)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **State Management**: Reflex State
- **Themes**: Moonlit Clearing (purple/indigo) + Enchanted Forest (green)

---

## Database Schema Enhancements Needed

### New Fields for Images Table:
```
- pose_keypoints: JSON (body joint coordinates)
- pose_cluster_id: INT
- action_labels: JSON array
- sequence_id: INT (foreign key to sequences table)
- frame_number: INT (position in sequence)
```

### New Tables:
```
- sequences: id, start_time, end_time, outfit_id, location
- pose_clusters: id, centroid, member_count
- action_taxonomy: id, name, parent_category
```

---

## Next Immediate Steps:

1. **Choose pose estimation model** (recommendation: MediaPipe for speed, OpenPose for accuracy)
2. **Define pose similarity metric** (cosine similarity of normalized keypoints is a good start)
3. **Set up pose detection pipeline** in FastAPI
4. **Test on sample fashion dataset** to validate quality
5. **Update database schema** to store pose data
6. **Create dashboard UI** for pose visualization

## Notes:
- Fashion/outfit image database focused on model photography
- Emphasis on pose variation and outfit diversity
- Need efficient processing for large image collections
- Real-time monitoring critical for long-running batch jobs
